        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Why cook your eggs and toast seperately?</p>
        <p>Efficiency at it's finest.</p>
        <p><i>*also called Eggs In The Basket</i></p>

        <h4>Ingredients (for one toad in the hole)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 slice sandwich bread</li>
            <li>couple tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>salt (as wanted)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>While pan heats (medium-heat), use a shot glass to cut 
                small circle out of center of the bread.
            </li>
            <li>Add some butter and begin toasting one side 
                of bread.
            </li>
            <li>Flip bread and put more butter in center. 
                Crack the egg into center.
            </li>
            <li>Once egg white is cooked enough so that it holds, gently 
                flip bread. Careful not to break the yolk!
            </li>
            <li>Cook egg whites on other side. This is fast. You want 
                the egg yolk to still be runny.
            </li>
            <li>Slide onto plate, sprinkle salt, enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
